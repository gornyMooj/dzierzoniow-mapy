## My Hometown on old Prussian Maps - [Basamp for Leaflet.js](https://gornymooj.github.io/dzierzoniow-mapy/)

This is the web app written only in Javascript without third-party CSS frameworks or plugins. All tools used in the process of the creation are open source and freely available on the internet. The aim of the app is to show my hometown and its surroundings on old Prussian maps (*[Messtischblatt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messtischblatt)*) and to be able to compare them with current maps.The application is not mobile friendly and it is not finished. However, the main objectives of this project have been completed.
